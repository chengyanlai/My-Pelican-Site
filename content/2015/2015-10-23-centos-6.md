Summary: How to install and setup centos

## Install from USB drive

### The image not found problem!

## ZSH shell

This is my favorite shell script! Simply install it from `yum`, and use `oh-my-zsh`.

## Fish shell

This is another alternative, but I am not very familiar with it yet.

  :::bash


## Devtoolset

The default CentOS 6 does not ship the updated gcc compiler and git, so we need to update it with the devtoolset. You may need to install `wget` and `curl` before this. Of cause, you need to be `sudo`.

  :::bash
  $ cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
  $ wget http://people.centos.org/tru/devtools-2/devtools-2.repo
  $ yum install devtoolset-2-gcc
  $ yum install devtoolset-2-binutils
  $ yum install devtoolset-2-gcc-c++ devtoolset-2-gfortran
  $ yum install devtoolset-2-gfortran
  $ yum install devtoolset-2-gcc-gfortran
  $ yum install devtoolset-2-git

After the installation, we need to make sure the system is using it!  
I do it in my own zsh plugin, by setting

  :::bash
  source /opt/rh/devtoolset-2/enable

You can put this inside your `.bashrc` or the corresponding shell config file.

## Ack

This is a alternative command for `grep`, very easy to use and fast. It is shipped within EPEL repo.

  :::bash
  $ wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-6.noarch.rpm
  $ sudo rpm -Uvh epel-release-6*.rpm
  $ sudo yum install ack
