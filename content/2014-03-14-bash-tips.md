Summary: How to copy file(s) to multiple subfolders

## Command cp
`cp` only can copy file(s) into single folder.
For example,

    :::bash
    $ cp foo.txt folder1 folder2

Above command will try to copy `foo.txt` and `folder1` into `folder2`. It will fail, however, since 
`folder1` is directory, not file!  

If what you want is to copy `foo.txt` into `folder1` and `folder2`, you need to use loop!

## Use xargs

It is good to check out the man page for `xargs`.

Here, I only cover the very basic usage.

In parent folder, suppose we have a file `foo.txt`.  
If we want to copy this file to some subfolders, like `folder1`, `folder2`, etc...  
, we can simply do

    :::bash
    $ echo folder* | xargs -n 1 cp foo.txt

The above command will execute `cp` multiple times, depend on how many folder you have in prefix `folder`.  
The `-n` tells `xargs` how many arguments you have, here is `1`, since `cp` is utility of `xargs`.  
If you need to copy two or more files, just change the number

    :::bash
    $ echo folder* | xargs -n 2 cp foo1.txt foo2.txt

Enjoy!
